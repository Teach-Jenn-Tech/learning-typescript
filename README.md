# Learning TypeScript w/ Josh Goldberg

‚ú®Hello beaufitul human! ‚ú®

You have heard a lot of love and/or irritation towards TypeScript ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è In this series Josh Goldberg, the author of Learning TypeScript, joins Jenn from Teach Jenn Tech to teach about TypeScript to Jenn, who is a super newb.

For the most part, you'd want to have a good understanding of some JavaScript frameworks... Jenn does not have the usual prerequisites of a deep understanding of JavaScript, which makes this adventure even more accessible for those breaking into tech and frustrating for those who already know TypeScript! ü§£

Join us every other Friday as we breakdown what Jenn doesn't understand from each chapter and Josh and Jenn work through the chapters' project together.
