# Learning TypeScript w/ Josh Goldberg

‚ú®Hello beaufitul human! ‚ú®

You have heard a lot of love and/or irritation towards TypeScript ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è In this series Josh Goldberg, the author of Learning TypeScript, joins Jenn from Teach Jenn Tech to teach about TypeScript to Jenn, who is a super newb.

For the most part, you'd want to have a good understanding of some JavaScript frameworks... Jenn does not have the usual prerequisites of a deep understanding of JavaScript, which makes this adventure even more accessible for those breaking into tech and frustrating for those who already know TypeScript! ü§£

Join us every other Friday as we breakdown what Jenn doesn't understand from each chapter and Josh and Jenn work through the chapters' project together.

  ## From JavaScript to TypeScript
Learning TypeScript's From JavaScript to TypeScript chapter covers the context for some of JavaScript's main weaknesses, where TypeScript comes into play, and how to get started with TypeScript:

A brief history of JavaScript
JavaScript's pitfalls: costly freedom, loose documentation, and weaker developer tooling
What TypeScript is: a programming language, a type checker, a compiler, and a language service
TypeScript's advantages: freedom through restriction, precise documentation, and stronger developer tooling
Getting started writing TypeScript code on the TypeScript Playground and locally on your computer
What TypeScript is not: a remedy for bad code, extensions to JavaScript (mostly), slower than JavaScript, or finished evolving
