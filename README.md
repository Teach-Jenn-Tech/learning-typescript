## Module/Chapter Breakdowns
### 1️⃣ From JavaScript to TypeScript
 [👀 Chapter 1 Recording](https://youtube.com/live/K710B5oMYAU?feature=share)

 [📝 The Typeinator Project](https://www.learningtypescript.com/from-javascript-to-typescript/the-typeinator/) If you're not a fan of classes, skip this project  😂


 Learning TypeScript's From JavaScript to TypeScript chapter covers the context for some of JavaScript's main weaknesses, where TypeScript comes into play, and how to get started with TypeScript:

A brief history of JavaScript
  - JavaScript's pitfalls: costly freedom, loose documentation, and weaker developer tooling
  - What TypeScript is: a programming language, a type checker, a compiler, and a language  service
  - TypeScript's advantages: freedom through restriction, precise documentation, and stronger developer tooling
  - Getting started writing TypeScript code on the TypeScript Playground and locally on your computer
  - What TypeScript is not: a remedy for bad code, extensions to JavaScript (mostly), slower than JavaScript, or finished evolving


### 2️⃣ The Type System

 [📝 System of a Clown Project](https://www.learningtypescript.com/the-type-system/system-of-a-clown/)

Learning TypeScript's The Type System chapter covers how TypeScript's type system works at its core:
- What a "type" is and the primitive types recognized by TypeScript
- What a "type system" is and how TypeScript's type system understands code
- How type errors compare to syntax errors
- Inferred variable types and variable assignability
- Type annotations to explicitly declare variable types and avoid evolving any types
- Object member checking on type shapes
- ECMAScript module files' declaration scoping compared to script files
