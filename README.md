## Module/Chapter Breakdowns
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ From JavaScript to TypeScript
 [üëÄ Chapter 1 Recording](https://youtube.com/live/K710B5oMYAU?feature=share)

 Learning TypeScript's From JavaScript to TypeScript chapter covers the context for some of JavaScript's main weaknesses, where TypeScript comes into play, and how to get started with TypeScript:

A brief history of JavaScript
  - JavaScript's pitfalls: costly freedom, loose documentation, and weaker developer tooling
  - What TypeScript is: a programming language, a type checker, a compiler, and a language  service
  - TypeScript's advantages: freedom through restriction, precise documentation, and stronger developer tooling
  - Getting started writing TypeScript code on the TypeScript Playground and locally on your computer
  - What TypeScript is not: a remedy for bad code, extensions to JavaScript (mostly), slower than JavaScript, or finished evolving

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Type System 
[üëÄ Chapter 2 Recording](https://youtube.com/live/2XGpHFmgrAQ?feature=share)

Learning TypeScript's The Type System chapter covers how TypeScript's type system works at its core:
  - What a "type" is and the primitive types recognized by TypeScript
  - What a "type system" is and how TypeScript's type system understands code
  - How type errors compare to syntax errors
  - Inferred variable types and variable assignability
  - Type annotations to explicitly declare variable types and avoid evolving any types
  - Object member checking on type shapes
  - ECMAScript module files' declaration scoping compared to script files
